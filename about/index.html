<p>Since this is my personal webpage, here's some random information about me!</p>

<ul class="about-list">
  <li>
    I am optimistic about the future of human kind.
    I like to think about the future and how technology and science will change the world.
    A fan of science fiction and futurology, favorite authors: E. Yudkowsky, G. Egan, R. Kurzweil, K. Eric Drexler, V. Vinge <br />
  </li>

  <li>
    Always curious about other disciplines: astrophysics, cosmology, particle physics, space exploration, evolutionary biology.
    Trying to follow the latest research so as not to be completely ignorant.
    Would love one day to work on a project at the juncture of disciplines (e.g. an AI robot for space exploration).
    <br />
  </li>

  <li>
    Random hobby: fast cars and motor racing (Formula 1, rally).
    I can drive too, in 2013 I won a 2nd place in a regional Red Bull Cart Fight competition!
  </li>

  <li>
    For my Master's thesis I designed a machine learning algorithm to predict stock prices.
    It worked well enough to stay profitable for a couple of months, but didn't make me a millionaire.
  </li>

  <li>
    In the year 2013 I started my own startup with friends, we made custom mobile applications for delivery businesses.
    The tech was great and we even had a couple of customers, but didn't have time to do sales. Note to self: next time hire a salesperson.
  </li>

  <li>
    I am most proficient with C++, C# and Python, but here's a (probably incomplete) list of programming languages I ever used to write a non-trivial program:
    Pascal, C, Delphi, C++, Assembler, Lua, Brainfuck, Forth, Objective-C, JS, C#, Java, Python, Scala, Ruby, F#, Bash, Prolog, TypeScript
  </li>

  <li>
    My favorite video games are Half-Life 2, Heroes of Might and Magic III, Team Fortress 2, Quake 3.
  </li>

  <li>
    I listen to all kinds of rock music, but my favorite is a Swedish band Opeth.
  </li>
  </ul>
