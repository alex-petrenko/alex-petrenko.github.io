<p>Since this is my personal webpage, here's some random information about me. Enjoy!</p>

<ul class="about-list">
  <li>
    I am optimistic about the future of human kind.
    I like to think about the future and how technology and science will change the world around us.
    A fan of science fiction and futurology, favorite authors: E. Yudkowsky, G. Egan, R. Kurzweil, K. Eric Drexler, V. Vinge    <br />
  </li>

  <li>
    Always curious about other disciplines: astrophysics, cosmology, particle physics, space exploration, evolutionary biology.
    I am trying to follow the latest research so as not to be completely ignorant.
    Would love one day to work on a project at the juncture of disciplines (e.g. an AI robot for space exploration).
    <br />
  </li>

  <li>
    Super-random hobby: fast cars and motor racing (Formula 1, rally).
    I am decent at driving too, in 2013 I won a 2nd place in a regional Red Bull Cart Fight competition!
  </li>

  <li>
    For my Master's thesis I designed a machine learning algorithm to predict stock prices.
    It worked well enough to stay profitable for quite some time, but didn't make me a millionaire.
  </li>

  <li>
    Interested in enterpreneurship.
    In the year 2013 I set up a startup with my friends called App-Master.
    We made custom mobile applications for delivery business.
    The tech was great and we even had a couple of  customers, but no one had time to do sales.
    And AI is much more interesting anyway, right? :)
  </li>

  <li>
    I am most proficient with C++, C# and Python, but here's a (probably incomplete) list of programming languages I ever used in a non-trivial software project:
    Pascal, C, Delphi, C++, Assembler, Lua, Brainfuck, Forth, Objective-C, JS, C#, Java, Python, Scala, Ruby, F#, Bash, SQL, Prolog, TypeScript...
  </li>

  <li>
    My favorite video games are Half-Life 2, Heroes of Might and Magic III, Team Fortress 2, Quake 3.
  </li>

  <li>
    I listen to all kinds of rock and metal music, but my favorite is a swedish band Opeth.
  </li>

  <li>
    I really like to travel and each year I try to go to as many places as I can.
    With my beloved wife Tanya I visited many amazing places in Russia, Europe, America and Asia.
  </li>

  </ul>
